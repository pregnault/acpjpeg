Description: JPEG images are converted into a n*3 matrix, where n stands for the number of pixels in the image and
    the columns are the Red, Green and Blue (RGB) channels of the pixels. Then, a PCA is performed.
    Outputs are two JPEG images obtained by projecting the original one to the (two) principal component(s).
